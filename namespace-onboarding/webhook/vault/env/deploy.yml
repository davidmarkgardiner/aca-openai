To inject a secret from HashiCorp Vault into your Kubernetes environment using Vault's Agent Injector and pass it to a Helm chart via a `values.yml` file, follow these steps:

### 1. Configure Vault Agent Injector
First, set up the Vault Agent Injector in your Kubernetes cluster to inject the secret into a Kubernetes Pod's environment variables.

Here's an example of how to annotate your Kubernetes deployment to use the Vault Agent Injector:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: your-deployment
  annotations:
    vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: "true"
    vault.hashicorp.com/role: "your-vault-role"
    vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-INFORMER_SECRET: "database/creds/db-app"
    vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-INFORMER_SECRET: |
      {{- with secret "database/creds/db-app" -}}
      export INFORMER_SECRET='{{ .Data.data.secret }}'
      {{- end }}
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: "true"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: your-container
        image: your-image
        env:
        - name: INFORMER_SECRET
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: <your-secret-name>  # This is where the Vault Agent Injector will inject the secret
              key: INFORMER_SECRET
```

### 2. Reference the Secret in `values.yml`
In your Helm chart's `values.yml` file, reference the `INFORMER_SECRET` environment variable:

```yaml
# values.yml
instance:
  INFORMER_SECRET: "{{ env 'INFORMER_SECRET' }}"
```

### 3. Pass the Secret to the Helm Chart
In your Helm chart, ensure that the secret is properly passed to the templates. You can do this by referencing the value from `values.yml`:

```yaml
# templates/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: {{ .Chart.Name }}
        image: {{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag }}
        env:
        - name: INFORMER_SECRET
          value: "{{ .Values.instance.INFORMER_SECRET }}"
```

### 4. Deploy the Helm Chart
Deploy your Helm chart as usual, and the secret should be injected into the Pod by the Vault Agent Injector, and then passed to the application via the Helm chart's `values.yml`.

### Recap
- **Vault Agent Injector**: Annotates the Kubernetes Pod to inject secrets from Vault.
- **values.yml**: References the injected secret using `{{ env 'INFORMER_SECRET' }}`.
- **Helm Chart**: Passes the secret to the application as an environment variable.

This setup ensures that the secret is securely managed by Vault and injected into your Kubernetes environment, where it can be consumed by your application through Helm.
